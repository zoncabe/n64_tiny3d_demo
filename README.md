### Nintendo 64 game demo

This project is being made using the open source SDK [Libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon). It uses the 3D ucode & library [Tiny3D](https://github.com/HailToDodongo/tiny3d).

### Compilation

I only tested on lubuntu 24.04.2.<br/>
You need to install [Libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/wiki/Installing-libdragon) and [Tiny3D](https://github.com/HailToDodongo/tiny3d/blob/main/README.md) on your machine, follow their guides on the links.<br/>
Then run make from the main folder and pray!

### Assets

All actors designed by yours truly, animated using [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com).<br/>
The test room uses the [Prototype retro textures pack](https://opengameart.org/content/prototype-textures-32x32px) by [Emerald Eel](https://opengameart.org/users/emerald-eel-entertainment). Licenced under CC0 / Public Domain.
